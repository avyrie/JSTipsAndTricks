# JavaScript Tips and Tricks

* Pro-tip: add the VSCode extension, Quokka.js - this will update the result of your code in real time so you don't have to keep running it in the console

This repo contains files that include useful information for when you are working in JavaScript. I will update this when I can with various tips and tricks tha I like to keep on hand. If you have anything to contribute that you think would be good for (especiall junior) software developers to know/have on hand, please message me or submit a merge request.
