# JavaScript Tips and Tricks

### Pro-tip: add the VSCode extension, Quokka.js - this will update the result of your code in real time so you don't have to keep running it in the console
- To use: add the extension, while in file on Mac type cmd + shift + P, select "Quokka.js: Start on Current File"

This repo contains files that include useful information for when you are working in JavaScript. I will update this when I can with various tips and tricks tha I like to keep on hand. If you have anything to contribute that you think would be good for (especiall junior) software developers to know/have on hand, please message me or submit a pull request.
